I created this React app with the design goal of reducing the overall cognitive load on users looking to total their
score in a game of 7 Wonders Duel.

The main improvements I was looking to make were:

* Minimize the number of interactions/inputs needed from the user
* Minimize any mental math the user might have to do
* Add relevant visualizations & graphics from the board game to help the user more easily understand the category
they're scoring
